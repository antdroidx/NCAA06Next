For rosters, you may get a .ps2 memory card file for pcsx2 courtesy of operation sports here:

2. 2021 Season Div 1AA Rosters for FBS Schools only (Appalachian State, Texas State, UMass, and Western Kentucky). The rest are auto-named default rosters.
3. Historical Teams Rosters

FBS Rosters were created using <a href=https://github.com/antdroidx/NCAA-Football-PS3-to-PS2-Roster-Porting-Tool>Antdroid's Roster Porting Tool</a> from the Operation Sports NCAA 14 PS3 team's base roster with permission.
