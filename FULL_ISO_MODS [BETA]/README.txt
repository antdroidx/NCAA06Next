Introduction
This is an exciting beta test that Antdroid and JDHalfrack want users to try out and experience a more modern version of NCAA Football 06 that merges modern day football alignment, rosters, coaches, names databases, uniform fixes, and other features into the original game. This is a proof of concept that we hope to build upon, but should be a fully working and hopefully a bug-free experience pushing the game's limits as we can today. We have more additions to this in the future planned, as long as they work!



Description of Project
This mod creates a brand new ISO and experience right out of the box. No more need for extraneous save files or DB edits. This mod adds all of it into a ready to use ISO or Disc.



NCAA-NEXT-MODERNIZED '21 This updates the original game with:

Updated Rosters built-in (thanks to OperationSports.com community for base PS3 roster to build from!)
Heisman Mode working with 2021 rosters
Updated Team Names (no more "indians")
Updated Coaches & Strategies, including FCS coaches built-in (thanks to Al from Playbookgamer.com for input!)
Updated Conf and Team Prestige, Rankings
Uniform Patches for Texture Mods
New First/Last Names Generation Database
In-Game Text Updates
Removed default Transfers
Updated Positional Importance
Realigned Conferences Built-In - Real Power 5 x 14 team/12 team conferences with "close to real" group of "6" (Based on 2022-2025 realignment plans)
New built-in schedule generator for conference structure changes
WKU, App State, UMass, Texas State -> FBS
Air Force, Army, Navy, Idaho -> FCS
Users will be able to swap teams within the in-game menu at dynasty start as normal
No external saves required for starting a new Dynasty, or updated roster saves!




KNOWN BUGS!

Since this is a beta and we've only done limited testing, bugs may occur! Please let us know when you get them!

There is one known bug, which seems to be a memory related issue, and for majority of users, this will never be a problem. If you simulate a string of weeks or a full season, PLEASE exit the schedule page, and to the main Dynasty menu, before you simulate more games! If you do not, it may cause an error to occur and the entire emulator will need to be rebooted and all progress lost.

This seems to be possibly due to overload of memory/resources, but we are still troubleshooting the root cause. In the mean time, just read the news and standings every time you simulate, and you should be fine.




INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



Pre-Requisite Software
A legal copy of NCAA Football 06, preferably in a dumped ISO format. If you only have the DISC, you can create an ISO from the software tool in number 2 below.

An ISO/Image Creation Software

I prefer this free software called ImgBurn, and the instructions are going to be based on this tool. You can opt to use your own ISO building software package.

https://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download

To avoid possible adware, use the Softpedia mirror link for downloading.

File Location
This mod can be found in the FULL_ISO_MODS folder after you download and unzip the NCAA NEXT package.


Within this folder you will find the installation ZIP files used in the instructions below.


Instructions

Setting up the ISO Patches
1. Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. In most cases, this will create a new virtual DVD drive, and open the Windows Explorer window to the contents of the DVD.

2. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like, and then Copy the entire contents of your ISO into the "NCAA06" folder.

3. Choose one of the NCAA 06 NEXT ISO Packages and UNZIP the contents into the "NCAA06" folder. This will ask you to Replace the Files... Click Replace.

4. In the "NCAA06" folder, there will be a file called Install.bat (or just Install). Double-click to run it. This will delete 3 files from your NCAA06 DATA folder: FE.QKL , GAME.QKL, PL.QKL, and then remove itself. You can also do this manually, if you do not want to run the batch file or get an error.


Creating the ISO in IMG BURN

5. Now open ImgBurn.

6. Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side.

7. On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the "NCAA06" root folder.

8. Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

9. Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO (NCAA 06 NEXT 21, for example), and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

10. Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!
